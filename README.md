🚀 Telco Customer Churn Prediction: Save Your Customers Before They Leave!

Are you curious about how machine learning can help telecom companies predict which customers are likely to leave? This project combines data science and AI to crack the code behind customer churn — a major challenge in the telecom industry!

🔥 Why This Project Matters

Every year, millions of telecom customers churn, costing companies billions in lost revenue. What if we could predict who’s about to leave and take action before it’s too late? That’s exactly what this project does.

Using real-world telecom data, I built a powerful machine learning model that identifies “at-risk” customers with impressive accuracy — helping businesses save money, improve loyalty, and boost profits.

🎯 What You’ll Find Here

Cleaned and preprocessed data ready for modeling

Step-by-step notebooks showing how I transformed raw data into insights

A robust machine learning model trained to predict churn with high precision

The full Streamlit app — an interactive, easy-to-use web interface for making predictions live!

Saved models and preprocessing tools so you can run predictions instantly
